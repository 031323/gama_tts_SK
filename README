Gnuspeech-X (eXperimental)
==========================

Gnuspeech-X is an articulatory speech synthesizer that uses code and
data from Gnuspeech (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuspeech/),
ported to C++/C. It is a command-line program. The graphical
applications have not been ported.

This project is based on code from Gnuspeech SVN, rev. 672,
downloaded in 2014-08-02. The source code was obtained from the
directories:

nextstep/trunk/ObjectiveC/Monet.realtime
nextstep/trunk/src/SpeechObject/postMonet/server.monet

This software is currently not part of Gnuspeech.
