GamaTTS
=======

GamaTTS is a command-line articulatory synthesizer that converts text
to speech.

GamaTTS is a port to C++/C of the TTS_Server in the original Gnuspeech
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuspeech/) source code written for NeXTSTEP,
provided by David R. Hill, Leonard Manzara, Craig Schock and contributors.
This project is based on code from Gnuspeech's Subversion repository,
revision 672, downloaded in 2014-08-02. The source code was obtained
from the directories:
nextstep/trunk/ObjectiveC/Monet.realtime
nextstep/trunk/src/SpeechObject/postMonet/server.monet

This software includes code from RapidXml (http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/),
provided by Marcin Kalicinski. See the file src/rapidxml/license.txt
for details.



Status
------

Only english is supported.

The quality of the synthesized speech is very far from the best speech
synthesizers. This software is mostly for people interested in articulatory
speech synthesis.
