		loss_factor
			Defines the acoustic loss inside the vocal tract.

vtm_control_model.config
	Contains the parameters for the vocal tract model controller.

	Interesting parameters are:

		voice_name
			If it is set to EXAMPLE the voice file named

		pitch_offset
			Modifies the voice pitch.

		drift_deviation
		drift_lowpass_cutoff
			Control the random perturbations in the intonation
			(requires intonation_drift = 1).

		dictionary_1_file

		glottal_pulse_tn_min
			Fall time, in % of the period - for the highest pulse
			amplitude.
		glottal_pulse_tn_max
			Fall time, in % of the period - for the lowest pulse
			amplitude.

			These parameters modify the glottal pulse shape.

		reference_glottal_pitch
			Modifies the voice pitch.
